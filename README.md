MarchCharts (originally CbbMetrics) is a dynamic client-side web app that graphically displays metrics used by the college basketball tournament committee to choose teams for the NCAA Tournament.

### Home
The home age shows teams' current metrics and allows for viewing changes over time. The table can be sorted by 
the column headers ascending or descending. The radio buttons "All" and "Bubble" allow for filtering of the table 
by teams that are near the cut line for making the tournament.

Color coding of individual table cells indicates whether a teams' metric changed for the better or worse over the 
specified time frame.
